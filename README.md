## My Links

This project aims to create a list of important websites to never forget.

Initial project: https://github.com/Rocketseat/youtube-masterclass-nodejs 

Two new features have been implemented: 
- Adding new links from user input;
- Deleting items from the list. 

It was necessary to do a communication with API (where are stored the links in json).
